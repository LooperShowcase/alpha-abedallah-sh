      The Xbox is a home video game console and the first installment in the
      Xbox series of video game consoles manufactured by Microsoft. It was
      released as Microsoft's first foray into the gaming console market on
      November 15, 2001, in North America, followed by Australia, Europe and
      Japan in 2002.[2] It is classified as a sixth-generation console,
      competing with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's GameCube. It was also
      the first major console produced by an American company since the release
      of the Atari Jaguar in 1993. The console was announced in March 2000.[11]
      With the release of the PlayStation 2, which featured the ability to
      playback CD-ROMs and DVDs in addition to playing games, Microsoft became
      concerned that game consoles would threaten the personal computer as an
      entertainment device for living rooms. Whereas most games consoles to that
      point were built from custom hardware components, the Xbox was built
      around standard personal computer components, using variations of
      Microsoft Windows and DirectX as its operating system to support games and
      media playback, and featuring a 733 MHz Intel Pentium III CPU and a 233
      MHz Nvidia GeForce 3-based NV2A GPU, the latter two making the Xbox
      technically more powerful compared to its rivals.[12] The Xbox was the
      first console to feature a built-in hard disk.[13][14] The console also
      was built with direct support for broadband connectivity to the Internet
      via an integrated Ethernet port,[15] and with the release of Xbox Live, a
      fee-based online gaming service, a year after the console's launch,
      Microsoft gained an early foothold in online gaming and made the Xbox a
      strong competitor in the sixth generation of consoles. The popularity of
      killer app blockbuster titles such as Bungie's Halo 2 contributed to the
      popularity of online console gaming, and in particular first-person
      shooters.[16] The Xbox had a record-breaking launch in North America,
      selling 1.5 million units before the end of 2001, aided by the popularity
      of one of the system's launch titles, Halo: Combat Evolved, which sold a
      million units by April 2002. The system went on to sell a worldwide total
      of 24 million units, including 16 million in North America; however,
      Microsoft was unable to make a steady profit off the console, which had a
      manufacturing price far more expensive than its retail price, despite its
      popularity, losing over $4 billion during its market life.[17][18] The
      system outsold the GameCube and the Sega Dreamcast, but was vastly outsold
      by the PlayStation 2, which had sold over 100 million units by the
      system's end of production.[19] It also underperformed outside of the
      Western market; particularly, it sold poorly in Japan due to its large
      console size and an overabundance of games marketed towards American
      audiences instead of Japanese-developed titles.[20] Production of the
      system was discontinued starting in 2005.[5][6] The Xbox was the first in
      an ongoing brand of video game consoles developed by Microsoft, with a
      successor, the Xbox 360, launching in November 2005, followed by the Xbox
      One in 2013 and the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles in 2020.
