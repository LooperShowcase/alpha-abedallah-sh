      is an American multinational technology corporation producing computer
      software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services
      headquartered at the Microsoft Redmond campus located in Redmond,
      Washington, United States. Its best-known software products are the
      Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the
      Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products
      are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface lineup of
      touchscreen personal computers. Microsoft ranked No. 21 in the 2020
      Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total
      revenue;[2] it was the world's largest software maker by revenue as of
      2019. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies,
      alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. Microsoft was founded by Bill
      Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, to develop and sell BASIC
      interpreters for the Altair 8800. It rose to dominate the personal
      computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by
      Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO), and subsequent
      rise in its share price, created three billionaires and an estimated
      12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has
      increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made a
      number of corporate acquisitions, their largest being the acquisition of
      LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in December 2016,[3] followed by their
      acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5 billion in May 2011.[4] As of
      2015, Microsoft is market-dominant in the IBM PC compatible operating
      system market and the office software suite market, although it has lost
      the majority of the overall operating system market to Android.[5] The
      company also produces a wide range of other consumer and enterprise
      software for desktops, laptops, tabs, gadgets, and servers, including
      Internet search (with Bing), the digital services market (through MSN),
      mixed reality (HoloLens), cloud computing (Azure), and software
      development (Visual Studio). Steve Ballmer replaced Gates as CEO in 2000,
      and later envisioned a "devices and services" strategy.[6] This unfolded
      with Microsoft acquiring Danger Inc. in 2008,[7] entering the personal
      computer production market for the first time in June 2012 with the launch
      of the Microsoft Surface line of tablet computers, and later forming
      Microsoft Mobile through the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services
      division. Since Satya Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, the company has
      scaled back on hardware and has instead focused on cloud computing, a move
      that helped the company's shares reach its highest value since December
      1999.[8][9] Earlier dethroned by Apple in 2010, in 2018 Microsoft
      reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded company in the
      world.[10] In April 2019, Microsoft reached the trillion-dollar market
      cap, becoming the third U.S. public company to be valued at over $1
      trillion after Apple and Amazon respectively. As of 2022, Microsoft has
      the fourth-highest global brand valuation. Microsoft has been criticized
      for its monopolistic practices and the company's software has been
      criticized for problems with ease of use, robustness, and security
